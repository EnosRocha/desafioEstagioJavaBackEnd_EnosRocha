Main features:
- CRUD
- Filter for filtering task by status, priority and deadline
- Authorization and authentication using JWT
- Database provided by a docker compose (ISOLATED in the ROOT of the project for deploy)
- Documentation with swagger

## Get started

1. First step : Clone the project from github
  - ```bash git clone git@github.com:EnosRocha/desafioEstagioJavaBackEnd_EnosRocha.git ```
2. Second step: adjust the properties.yml by editing the database information
    ```yml
    spring:
      datasource:
        url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3310/{DATABASENAME}
        username: {YOURNAME}
        password: {YOUR PASSWORD}
      jpa:
        hibernate:
          ddl-auto: update 

    
  - **OBS**: remeber of passing this edited information in the docker-compose.yml, the same way they are written in the properties.yml 
3. Third step: Build the docker container up in the project terminal
    ``` bash
    docker compose up 
4. Fourth: Run the project using maven
   ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
